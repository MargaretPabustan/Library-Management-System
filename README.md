# 📚 Library Management System

A full-stack Library Management Web App designed for administrators and users to manage books and publishers. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **EJS**, **MySQL**, and **Bootstrap**, it supports full CRUD operations, user authentication, image uploads, a borrow cart, fines, and profile management.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Client (Browser / EJS Views)  
↓  
Express.js (Route Handlers + Business Logic)  
↓  
MySQL Database  

This project is a **monolithic Express.js application** using server-side rendering with EJS.

### How the system works:
- EJS handles UI rendering on the server side
- Express route handlers manage both routing and business logic
- Authentication and authorization are implemented using Express middleware functions (checkAuthentication and checkAdmin)
- Session-based storage is used to manage login state and user roles (RBAC).  
- MySQL is used for persistent data storage.

### Key Design Characteristics:
- No separate controller/service layers (logic is handled directly in route handlers)
- Middleware functions are defined within the main application file (not modularized)
- RBAC is implemented using session-based role checks in both Express routes and EJS conditional rendering (`req.session.user.role`)
- Fully server-rendered application using EJS (no frontend SPA framework)

## 👥 Team Contributions & System Scope
This CA2 project was developed collaboratively, with each member responsible for different modules.

### 📚 Module Ownership

- **Books Page - Sahana**
Implemented full CRUD operations for books including image upload, search bar functionality and stock handling (availability)

## 📚 Publisher Page - Margaret (Me)

Developed full CRUD functionality for the publisher module, including search capability.

- Create, view, update, and delete publishers
- Search publishers by relevant fields (Name, Address, Country)
- Integrated role-based access control (admin-only actions such as edit and delete)
- Implemented frontend permission checks using EJS conditional rendering

All publisher-related logic is handled within a single Express route file. While not separated into a full MVC structure, the code is organised into clear sections for CRUD operations, search functionality, and access control to maintain readability and structure.


- **Loan Page - Samuel**
Implemented borrowing workflow including:
- View borrowed records functionality
- Return functionality (fully working)
- Additional CRUD (Add/Update Loans) were partially implemented
 
- **User Authentication & Access Control – Yi Xi (collaborative module)**  
Collaborated on the application’s role-based access control system by implementing frontend-level permission for my publisher page rendering using EJS.

Yi Xi focused on the User module and role management using session data. I contributed by implementing RBAC within the Publisher module to restrict admin-only actions (edit/delete/add) using session-based checks and EJS conditional rendering.

### Publisher Module RBAC Implementation (publishers.ejs)
<% if (user && user.role === 'admin') { %>
  <th>Edit</th>
  <th>Delete</th>
<% } %>

  <% if (user && user.role === 'admin') { %>
            <td>
              <a href="/updatePublisher/<%= publisher.publisher_id %>" class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm">Edit</a>
            </td>
            <td>
              <a href="/deletePublisher/<%= publisher.publisher_id %>" 
                 onclick="return confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this publisher?')" 
                 class="btn btn-outline-danger btn-sm">Delete</a>
            </td>
          <% } %>

## 🚀 Installation Process

1. Install dependencies:
npm install
npm init -y 

2. Set up MySQL database:
Create a database (e.g. librarydb)
Run the provided SQL scripts to create tables (books, publishers, users)

3. Configure DB pool in app.js (Updated: new database created for portfolio demonstration purposes, as the DB used for the project has expired)

const pool = mysql.createPool({
    host: '784jfr.h.filess.io',
    port: 3307,
    user: 'librarydb_balloonlog',
    password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE',
    database: 'librarydb_balloonlog',
    waitForConnections: true,
    connectionLimit: 10,
    queueLimit: 0
});

4. Run the application:
npx nodemon app.js

5. Open in browser:
- Locally: http://localhost:3000 
- Live: (Render deployment link here)

 ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions 

--  Margaret's Reflection (below)
1. Learning GitHub workflow
Challenge: At the start, I was unfamiliar with GitHub basics such as committing, pushing, and navigating the repository. This slowed down collaboration.

Solution: I practiced using Git commands (git add, git commit, git push) and learned to manage branches. By the end, I was confident in contributing and keeping my module synced with the team repo.

2. Routing syntax and logic
Challenge: Some Express routes failed due to incorrect syntax or misplaced logic.

Solution: I debugged by carefully checking route definitions, middleware order, and testing endpoints with Postman. This ensured CRUD operations worked consistently.

3. Module Integration
Challenge: Integrating my Publisher module with teammates’ modules required aligning database schema and session data.

Solution: We coordinated as a team to standardize schema fields and role checks. My module was successfully integrated with shared authentication  and RBAC logic through collaboration.

**Shared Authentication** – Integrated Yi Xi's module with mine
